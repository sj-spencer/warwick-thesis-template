\section{Conclusion}


\subsection{Does any of this matter?}

A recent paper by \citet{Nicholas2021} suggests that fusion energy (whether through ICF or magnetically confined fusion) will not be ready in time to act as a replacement for fossil fuels, which must be removed from the energy mix by the middle of the 21st century if we are to avoid the worst impacts of catastrophic climate change. They assume that, by the second half of the 21st century, renewable energies such as wind and solar will power most of the grid. However, the intermittent nature of these mechanisms will leave a gap in the energy market for a carbon-free source of baseload energy \citep{Nicholas2021}. In order for fusion energy to be a good choice for filling this gap it must be able to demonstrate its superiority over traditional nuclear fission power generation. This may include showing its better performance in terms of: waste production; ease of proliferation; and resource supply. In light of this analysis, the work presented in this thesis may never directly contribute to usable, or desirable, ICF energy-generation schemes.
