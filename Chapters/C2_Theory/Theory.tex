\section{Plasma kinetic instabilities}
\subsection{Parametric instabilities}
\subsection{Trapped particle modulation instability}
\subsection{Landau damping}

\section{Linear theory}
The aim of the linear theory of \acrshort{SBS} is to understand how the growth
 of the instability depends on factors such as: plasma density; laser intensity; and temperature.
\subsection{Dispersion curves and linear modes}
\subsection{Absolute and convective growth}
Chapter 11 of Linear and Non-linear waves
Want to see plots like \cite{Strozzi2007}, and use their method for solving
electrostatic dispersion maybe? Electrostatic linear modes are found by solving
 $\epsilon = 1 + \chi = 0$ for complex $\omega$ given real $k$

\section{Quasi-linear theory}
\subsection{Landau damping}

\section{Nonlinear theory}
\subsection{Nonlinear Landau damping}
non-linear basis for trapping induced SRS modes found in \cite{Rose2001}, also
 a thing called the nonlinear dielectric function



\section{Zoology/topology of modes}
\subsection{Beam acoustic modes}
\subsection{Electron acoustic modes}
ie on the omega,k diagram how many things are there that we should be worried
about? BGK modes, Bohm-Gross waves; Beam acoustic modes, other acoustic modes.
etc. Where are they and how do they relate? Ie the Bohm-Gross and Electron
Acoustic modes join at klD~0.53

\section{Autoresonance}
