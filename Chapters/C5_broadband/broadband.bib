	title = {Suppression of parametric instabilities in inhomogeneous plasma with multi-frequency light},
	abstract = {The development of parametric instabilities in a large scale inhomogeneous plasma with an incident laser beam composed of multiple frequency components is studied theoretically and numerically. Firstly, theoretical analyses of the coupling between two laser beamlets with certain frequency difference δω0 for parametric instabilities is presented. It suggests that the two beamlets will be decoupled when δω0 is larger than certain thresholds, which are derived for stimulated Raman scattering, stimulated Brillouin scattering, and two plasmon decay, respectively. In this case, the parametric instabilities for the two beamlets develop independently and can be controlled at a low level provided the laser intensity for individual beamlet is low enough. Secondly, numerical simulations of parametric instabilities with two or more beamlets (N∼20) have been carried out and the above theory model is validated. Simulations conﬁrm that the development of parametric instabilities with multiple beamlets can be controlled at a low level, provided the threshold conditions for δω0 is satisﬁed, even though the total laser intensity is as high as ∼1015 W cm−2. With such a laser beam structure of multiple frequency components and total bandwidth of a few percentages (4\%ω0), the parametric instabilities can be wellcontrolled.},

	abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are used to study the nonlinear process of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) excited by a rotated polarized laser interacting with underdense plasmas. The inﬂuence of the rotating frequency on linear SRS growth rate is theoretically analyzed and the long-term nonlinear SRS behavior excited by the rotated polarized pump is illustrated by the PIC simulations. Our results show that the evolution of reﬂectivity, plasma wave and electron energy distribution in the nonlinear stage is quite different from that in the linear stage, which is principally caused by the mitigation of electron trapping. Furthermore, our ﬂuid theory and simulations have demonstrated that opposite to the suppression of Raman backscattering, Raman forward scattering becomes stronger with increasing rotating frequency. The above nonlinear effects are valid in the regime of I {\textasciitilde} 1015 W cm-2, klD = 0.3 and a plasma length of hundreds of microns for the key role of the kinetic effect.},

The threshold values, however, exhibit signiﬁcant quantitative differences. Comparisons between the thresholds calculated for various broadband power spectra indicate a universal scaling of the threshold intensity with laser coherence time (sc).

	abstract = {Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) excited by incoherent light is studied via particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that a large bandwidth of incoherent light can reduce the growth of SRS and electron heating considerably in the linear stage. However, different components of the incoherent light can be coupled by the Langmuir waves, so that stimulated Raman backward scattering can develop. When the bandwidth of incoherent light is larger than the Langmuir wave frequency, forward SRS can be seeded between different components of the incoherent light. The incoherent light can only increase the time duration for nonlinear saturation but cannot diminish the saturation level obviously.},
