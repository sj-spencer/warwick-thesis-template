\chapter{Effects of laser bandwidth on inflationary stimulated Raman scattering}
\label{chp:broadbandSRS}

\section{Motivation and literature review}

\subsection{Homogeneous plasmas}
\subsubsection{Decoupled broadband lasers}
In \cite{zhao_suppression_2019} they consider the suppression of parametric
instabilities in a homogeneous plasma by decoupled broadband lasers
(\acrshort{DBL}). A
decoupled broadband laser is defined in Ref \cite{zhao_effective_2017} as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:DBL}
  a_{\mathrm{DBL}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \mathrm{cos}(\omega_it + \phi_i),
\end{equation}
where $a_i,\omega_i,\phi_i$ are the amplitude, carrier frequency, and phase of
each of the $N$ beamlets. The central frequency and wavelength of the laser is
$(\omega_0,k_0)$ and the total frequency spectrum bandwidth is
$\Delta\omega_0$.
Considering the frequency difference between any two beamlets, they find that
there is a critical frequency difference below which the SRS instability regions
for the beamlets overlap to form a single instability region. In this case, the
two beamlets can be coupled with one EPW, leading to a higher growth rate for
SRS. An important result of their one-dimensional PIC simulations is that iSRS
instability can grow to a high level if the beamlets satifsy this coupling
condition, even if the total bandwidth is very large.

\subsubsection{Strongly kinetic regime}
In Ref \cite{zhou_kinetic_2018} Zhou \textit{et al.} consider the case of SRS
driven by a broadband laser for a homogeneous plasma, with NIF-relevant plasma
density and temperature such that $\kld > 0.3$. The result most relevant to our
work is that the bandwidth can interact with the nonlinear frequency shift associated
with electron trapping in the SRS EPW to \emph{enhance} SRS rather than suppress it.


\subsection{Inhomogeneous plasmas}


\subsection{Decoupled broadband lasers}
Zhao \textit{et al.} \cite{zhao_effective_2017} consider the case of an
inhomgeneous plasma density profile relevant to indirect-drive ICF. The results
are similar to those described in the homogeneous case, and they find a
condition for the complete suppression of SRS. The follow-up paper
\cite{zhao_suppression_2019} finds that SRS can be well controlled for a laser
beam structure of multiple frequency components and total bandwidth of a few
percent. The parameters considered in this study are
$\lambda_0=0.33\si{\micro\metre}$,
$T_e=2\si{\kilo\electronvolt}$, $n_e = [0.08,0.12]n_c$, giving $\kld \sim
[0.26,0.35]$, well within the kinetic regime for SRS.

They derive a gain exponent for standard convective SRS driven by two
beamlets of different frequencies, and find that two beamlets are independent
when
\begin{equation}\label{DLB_threshold_inhomo}
\delta \omega_{0} \geq \frac{\pi n_{0} c\left(\omega_{0}^{2}-\omega_{p
e}^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}}{8 L \omega_{0} \omega_{L}^{2} \nu_{p}^{2}}.
\end{equation}
Importantly, this condition is independent of the amplitude of the incident
laser. In theory, this condition would allow us to construct a DBL to suppress
SRS in a large-scale inhomogeneous plasma, however, secondary amplification of
back-scattered light by one of the beamlets is a possibility. We must therefore
consider another threshold for this secondary amplification: $\delta\omega_0 >
\omega_{L1}-\omega_{L2}$ where $[\omega_{L1},\omega_{L2}]$ is the range of EPW
frequencies excited by SRS in the plasma (not including nonlinear frequency
shift).



\subsection{SSD-type bandwidth}
 Han Wen in Feb 2019 was working on SSD-type bandwidth defined like so:
 $$E_{pump} = 0.5E_0\left(exp[i(\omega_0t-kx+\sum_MA_Msin(\omega_Mt))]\right)$$.

Considering all of these results together, it is not at all clear how a
broadband laser driver will affect inflationary SRS in a long scale-length
inhomogeneous plasma relevant to SI.

\section{1D simulations and threshold}
The first step of this work was to design a perfect example of SRS due to
autoresonance
