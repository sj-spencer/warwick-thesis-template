\chapter{Effects of laser bandwidth on inflationary stimulated Raman scattering}
\label{chp:broadbandSRS}

\section{Motivation and literature review}

\subsection{Homogeneous plasmas}
\subsubsection{Decoupled broadband lasers}
In \cite{zhao_suppression_2019} they consider the suppression of parametric
instabilities in a homogeneous plasma by \acrfull{DBL}. A
decoupled broadband laser is defined in Ref \cite{zhao_effective_2017} as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:DBL}
  a_{\mathrm{DBL}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \mathrm{cos}(\omega_it + \phi_i)
\end{equation},
where $a_i,\omega_i,\phi_i$ are the amplitude, carrier frequency, and phase of
each of the $N$ beamlets. The central frequency and wavelength of the laser is
$(\omega_0,k_0)$ and the total frequency spectrum bandwidth is
$\Delta\omega_0$.
Considering the frequency difference between any two beamlets, they find that
there is a critical frequency difference below which the SRS instability regions
for the beamlets overlap to form a single instability region. In this case, the
two beamlets can be coupled with one EPW, leading to a higher growth rate for
SRS. An important result of their one-dimensional PIC simulations is that iSRS
instability can grow to a high level if the beamlets satifsy this coupling
condition, even if the total bandwidth is very large.

\subsection{Inhomogeneous plasmas}
\subsection{Decoupled broadband lasers}
Zhao \textit{et al.} \cite{zhao_effective_2017} consider the case of an
inhomgeneous plasma density profile relevant to indirect-drive ICF. The results
are similar to those described in the homogeneous case, and they find a
condition for the complete suppression of SRS. The follow-up paper
\cite{zhao_suppression_2019} finds that SRS can be well controlled for a laser
beam structure of multiple frequency components and total bandwidth of a few
percent.

\subsection{SSD-type bandwidth}
 Han Wen in Feb 2019 was working on SSD-type bandwidth defined like so:
 $$E_{pump} = 0.5E_0\left(exp[i(\omega_0t-kx+\sum_MA_Msin(\omega_Mt))]\right)$$.
