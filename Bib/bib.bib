These beam-smoothing techniques are directly applicable to direct-drive ignition target designs for the 192-beam, 1.8-MJ, 351-nm National Ignition Facility. Equivalent-target-plane images for constant-intensity laser pulses of varying duration were used to determine the smoothing. The properties of the phase plates, frequency modulators, and birefringent wedges were simulated and found to be in good agreement with the measurements.},

	abstract = {The development of parametric instabilities in a large scale inhomogeneous plasma with an incident laser beam composed of multiple frequency components is studied theoretically and numerically. Firstly, theoretical analyses of the coupling between two laser beamlets with certain frequency difference δω0 for parametric instabilities is presented. It suggests that the two beamlets will be decoupled when δω0 is larger than certain thresholds, which are derived for stimulated Raman scattering, stimulated Brillouin scattering, and two plasmon decay, respectively. In this case, the parametric instabilities for the two beamlets develop independently and can be controlled at a low level provided the laser intensity for individual beamlet is low enough. Secondly, numerical simulations of parametric instabilities with two or more beamlets (N ∼ 20) have been carried out and the above theory model is validated. Simulations confirm that the development of parametric instabilities with multiple beamlets can be controlled at a low level, provided the threshold conditions for δω0 is satisfied, even though the total laser intensity is as high as ∼1015 W cm−2. With such a laser beam structure of multiple frequency components and total bandwidth of a few percentages (≳4%ω0), the parametric instabilities can be well-controlled.}

Most of this research has centered on the krypton-fluoride (KrF) laser. In this article we review the advantages of the KrF laser for direct-drive ICF, the history of high-energy KrF laser development, and the present state of the art and describe a development path to the performance needed for laser fusion and its energy application. We include descriptions of the architecture and performance of the multi-kilojoule Nike KrF laser-target facility and the 700 J Electra high-repetition-rate KrF laser that were developed at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. Nike and Electra are the most advanced KrF lasers for inertial fusion research and energy applications.},

The spatial incoherence is created by imposing different optical delays upon different transverse sections of the beam, and choosing the delay increments to be larger than the laser coherence time tc=1/δν. This technique may allow easy attainment of the pellet illumination uniformity required for laser fusion.}
